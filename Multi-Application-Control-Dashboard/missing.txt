Missing RBAC Functionality
1. Incomplete Permission Enforcement in Content Modules
Issue: Content controllers like blog.controller.ts lack proper permission guards using the available decorators
Evidence: The blog controller only uses JwtAuthGuard but doesn't implement granular permission checks
Missing: @Permissions, @CanView, @CanCreate, @CanEdit, @CanDelete decorators are not used in content module controllers
2. Missing "Normal User" Role Implementation
Issue: The system defines 4 roles (Super Admin, Admin, Normal User, Viewer) but Normal User functionality is incomplete
Evidence: In users.service.ts, Normal Users are only given access to Profile and Settings modules, but there's no redirection mechanism to their personal dashboard
Missing: The specific behavior described where Normal Users should be redirected to a restricted admin-style dashboard for managing their own data
3. Frontend Dynamic UI Updates Missing
Issue: While the sidebar has some role-based visibility logic, there's no comprehensive frontend authorization directive
Evidence: No Angular structural directives like *appHasPermission or *appHasRole to conditionally render UI elements
Missing: Dynamic button disabling/hiding based on granular permissions
4. Missing Action-Level Permission Enforcement
Issue: The backend has permission guards but content modules aren't properly implementing granular permissions
Evidence: Blog, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Study Notes controllers don't use the PermissionGuard with specific action requirements
Missing: Individual route protection for CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE operations based on user's specific permissions
5. Incomplete Admin Permission Assignment
Issue: Admin permissions are defined by Super Admin, but the UI for assigning granular module permissions to Admin users appears incomplete
Evidence: While the backend has functions to assign module permissions, there's no clear UI workflow for Super Admin to configure specific permissions per Admin user
6. Missing Granular Module Permission Assignment
Issue: The system has capability for granular permissions but doesn't implement the full "View only", "View + Create", "View + Edit", "Full CRUD" options
Evidence: The permission system exists but isn't fully utilized in the controllers
7. Missing Frontend Authorization Directives/Guards
Issue: No frontend authorization guards or structural directives for protecting routes or hiding UI elements
Evidence: No Angular guards checking permissions before route activation
Missing: Components that conditionally render based on user permissions
8. Incomplete Viewer Role Implementation
Issue: Viewer role is read-only but may still have access to some restricted UI elements
Evidence: While backend restricts non-view actions, frontend may still show interactive elements
9. Missing Permission Validation in Content Services
Issue: Content services like blog service don't validate user permissions before performing operations
Evidence: Service methods don't check if the user has the required permissions to perform actions
10. Missing Normal User Redirection Logic
Issue: The requirement for Normal Users to be redirected to a restricted dashboard when editing profile/account settings is not implemented
Evidence: No routing logic that redirects Normal Users to a personal dashboard for self-management
Recommended Fixes
Add permission decorators to all content module controllers
Implement frontend authorization directives for conditional UI rendering
Create route guards for frontend permission checking
Enhance the Normal User flow with proper redirection logic
Complete the Admin permission assignment UI for Super Admins
Add permission validation in service layer methods
Implement comprehensive UI element visibility based on permissions
The system has a solid foundation with the role and permission models, but the implementation is incomplete across both frontend and backend layers according to your specified requirements.
